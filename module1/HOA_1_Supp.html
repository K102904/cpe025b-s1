<h2>Domestic Shorthair</h2>
<p>"A Domestic Shorthair (DSH) isn't a specific breed but a general term for mixed-breed cats with short coats, known for their diverse looks<br> (any color/pattern, medium size, round head/paws) and hardy nature from mixed genetics, making them adaptable, affectionate companions <br> with typical cat behaviors like hunting and requiring basic grooming like weekly brushing."</p>
